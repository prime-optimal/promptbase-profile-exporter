# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository. Keep it accurate; if
you change behavior that contradicts a line here, update this file in the same
change.

## What this is

A dependency-free Python tool that exports a public PromptBase profile's prompts
into TXT / Markdown / JSON / CSV catalogs. It ships three surfaces over one core:
a CLI, a local web UI, and a composite GitHub Action.

## Hard constraints (do not break)

- **Standard library only at runtime.** No third-party runtime dependencies,
  ever. `requirements.txt` is intentionally empty. Dev tools (ruff, mypy,
  coverage, build, twine) live in the `dev` optional-dependencies group only.
- **Python 3.10+.** Match existing style: `from __future__ import annotations`,
  PEP 604 unions, full type hints. The package ships `py.typed`; keep `mypy`
  clean.
- **Public data only.** The tool reads the same public Firestore data the
  website serves — no auth, no cookies, no scraping of private endpoints.
- **The web UI is a local, single-user tool.** Preserve its security model
  (see below) when touching `web.py`.

## Architecture (one line each)

`promptbase_exporter/`
- `cli.py` — argparse CLI, option validation (`normalize_options`), and the
  `main()` orchestration + exit codes (0 ok / 1 error / 2 `--fail-on-diff`).
- `client.py` — public PromptBase/Firestore access: profile resolution,
  paginated queries, retry/backoff, and schema-drift detection.
- `dates.py` — shared `parse_datetime_ms` (used by both `cli.py` and `web.py`).
- `models.py` — `Profile` and `PromptRecord` (frozen dataclasses + derived
  properties like `url`, `created_iso`, `is_text`/`is_image`/`is_free`).
- `formatting.py` — filtering, sorting, the per-format writers, and
  `count_written_records` (post-write validation).
- `diffing.py` — catalog comparison (`--compare`/`--update-file`) and reports.
- `web.py` — stdlib `http.server` UI; mirrors CLI options as a form.
- `__main__.py` — `python -m promptbase_exporter` entry point.

`action.yml` is the composite GitHub Action; it must stay in sync with the CLI.

## Commands

Install dev tools once: `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`

The local equivalent of CI (run before committing):

```
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy
python -m coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m coverage report      # must stay >= 70%
```

Run the tool: `python -m promptbase_exporter @acb --dry-run`
Run the web UI: `python -m promptbase_exporter.web`

A `PostToolUse` hook lints edited `.py` files with ruff automatically; it skips
silently if ruff is not installed.

## Conventions

- **Branch → PR → main.** `main` is protected and requires green CI. Never push
  to `main` directly; work on a feature branch and open a PR.
- **Tests are required** for behavior changes (`unittest`, no pytest). Mirror
  the existing test style; keep coverage >= 70%.
- **Update docs in the same change:** add a `## Unreleased` entry to
  `CHANGELOG.md`, and update the README options table / `docs/github-action.md`
  when user-facing flags change.
- **Pin GitHub Actions to commit SHAs** with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment.
  Dependabot updates these weekly.
- **No PyPI.** Distribution is via clone or the pinned Action tag. See
  `RELEASE.md`. There is no publish workflow.

## Adding things (cross-cutting checklists)

These touch several files; the `.claude/skills/` skills encode the full steps:
- New CLI flag → `add-cli-option` skill (cli.py + web.py + action.yml + tests +
  README + CHANGELOG).
- New output format → `add-export-format` skill (formatting.py + diffing.py +
  validation + tests + docs).
- Cutting a release → `release` skill (versions + CHANGELOG + tag + GitHub
  Release).

## Web UI security model (preserve when editing `web.py`)

- Binds to `127.0.0.1` by default; warns on non-loopback binds.
- `POST /export` rejects cross-origin (CSRF) and rebound-DNS requests via the
  `Host` header and `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site`.
- Output directories are confined to the server's working directory (no
  absolute paths, no `..`).
- `GET /download` only serves files inside that directory whose names match the
  exporter's own pattern (`_EXPORT_FILENAME_RE`) — it must not become an
  arbitrary file read.
- Every response carries the security headers in `_send`. New endpoints must
  keep equivalent protections.
